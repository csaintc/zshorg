* My literate =zsh= configuration.

This is my org-mode configuration, based off of my previous [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh]]
setup.

Not everything is explained in prose yet, but I'll get there, for my
own good.

This is, and will be, a work in progress. And somtime I hope a work of
beauty.

The whole configuration setup is in =zshrc.org=, the file is split
during tangling.

** Prerequisites
- emacs 24
- org-mode >= 7.8.03 (exported after 23d january 2012)
- make

** Installation
1. Clone the github repository
   #+begin_src sh
     cd $HOME
     git clone git://github.com/tomterl/zshorg.git .zshorg
   #+end_src
2. Read the file =zshrc.org= and tinker with the settings.
   
3. Backup your existing config
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     mkdir -p ~/Backups
     tar cfvz ~/Backups/zsh-config-$(date +"%F-%T") ~/.zshrc ~/.zsh.d
   #+END_SRC
4. Generate the new config
   Either =C-c C-v C-t= while visiting the file =zshrc.org= in emacs, or
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cd ~/.zshorg
     make config
   #+END_SRC
   this will overwrite =~/.zshrc= and a couple of files in =~/.zsh.d=;
   make sure you have backups.
